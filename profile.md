<h2>Bio, Education and Interests</h2>
<p> Pharmaceutical Scientist with a view to branch into medtech

Master of Pharmacy (hons) BSc Pharmacology (hon) 

I love my family, learning new things, watching great movies, crochet and travelling.

 *Inspiring others and being inspired.* </p>

 My top favourite movies in no particular order but given an order as part of this exercise are:

 1. 1917 
 2. Get Out
 3. Inside Man
 4. Beast of no nation
 5. Encanto (*for the bangers of course*)

  My favourite website is [Google](https://www.google.co.uk)
 However presently and due to coding being my new favourite thing [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp) follows as a close second.

 At he conclusion of this bootcamp I would like to be able to 

 1. Confidently code (HTML, JS, Python,) *understand more about formatting and general principles that apply to most coding languages*
 2. Utilise the different languages to design visual appealing and functional websites
 3. Be able to apply my learning to other area's merging my pharmaceutical knowledge with a view of going into machine learning and medtech
